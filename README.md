# vision

Adding more stuff over time - if I have the time and the need.

# how it began

I had some TTRPG tools from over the years (in C#, Go, Elixir, etc). Around three years ago, they became an Obsidian plugin. But the updates broke the plugin, and I never got around to fixing it (stopped using Obsidian for a while). Recently, played some solo RPG and wanted to use the plugin again, so I fixed it & cleaned it up. Hopefully they don't break the plugin system anytime soon. Enjoy!
